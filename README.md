# AI-Powered-Image-Editor
This project is an AI-powered image editor that allows users to transform their images into either "happy" or "scary" versions using advanced machine learning models. The frontend is built with React.js for a responsive and interactive user interface, while the backend is powered by Flask (Python) to handle image processing tasks.
